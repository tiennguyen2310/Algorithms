# Problem Statement

Given a ***directed*** graph `G = (V, E)` with `N` vertices and `M` edges.

**Task:** Count the number of strongly connected components of `G`.

## **Input**

The first line contains `N`, `M`.

In the next `M` lines: each line contains 2 integers `u, v` separated by at least one space, representing a directed edge `(u, v)`.

## **Output**
Prints a single number representing the number of Strongly Connected Components.

## **Sample Input**
```
3 2
1 2
2 3
```
## **Sample Output**
```
3
```
